Here the two files with private/public key should be stored. Using these files you will sign/verify your code.

To generate these files, you need an OpenSSL installation.

Example - to generate these files in Linux, you should execute the following commands:

$ openssl genrsa -out priv.pem 1024
$ openssl rsa -in priv.pem -pubout -out pub.pem
